                    <p class="mt-3">Please read the full terms below, but in order to simplify things here are a couple of bullet points to understand our privacy policy and how we handle data.</p>

                    <p>We automate things, but at the end of the day, pretty much all data you see on Livecounts.io is akin to going to your public profile on a social media site and writing down your follower count/etc. We don't store, show or share private information unless explicitly stated and requested and permission is granted. Furthermore, we feel our job is a bit like a journalist. We want to be a trusted source of information and that means not accepting requests to remove or change information we have listed unless there is something inaccurate with it. The world comes to us to see transparent follower/etc numbers to see if there is any "fishy business" going on. If we remove this data when requested it ruins our credibility. As the data we are displaying is public data anyone could have gotten from visiting your profile anyway we don't feel like this should raise any privacy concerns.</p>

                    <p>Just like the rest of the Internet we use cookies. Cookies aren't evil, they're the way you can log into a website once and stay logged in until you log out instead of typing your login/password on every page.</p>

                    <p>We provide our services for the most part free of charge. Servers cost money though as well as the team to program them. For this reason we monetize the site via ads.</p>

                    <p>You come to Livecounts.io for analytics. Analytics also helps us know how many people are using the site, which parts of the site you use the most often, etc. It helps us build out things you're interested in and not focus on things you're not. Google Analytics and other analytics tools we may use from time to time also aren't evil. Without things like this we wouldn't know how to help you!</p>

                    <p>We hope this more informal, yet also more informative privacy policy helped. Again see below the more "legal" version but there shouldn't be anything surprising there if you read this section.</p>

                    <h4>The Privacy Policy and what does it mean to you.</h4>
